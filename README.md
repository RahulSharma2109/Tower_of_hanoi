# Tower_of_hanoi
This Python project solves the Tower of Hanoi problem using a recursive algorithm. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science that demonstrates the power of recursion and divide-and-conquer algorithms. The solution will calculate the steps needed to move all disks from the source peg to the target peg, using an auxiliary peg, and will also display the total number of moves required.

**Project Overview**

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where you have three pegs and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective is to move all the disks from a source peg to a target peg, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move involves taking the top disk from one of the pegs and placing it on another peg.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

This project asks for user input to specify the number of disks and the names of the source, auxiliary, and target pegs, then prints out each step in the solution.

**Features**
1. Recursive Solution: Uses a recursive algorithm to solve the problem efficiently.
2. Move Display: Shows each individual move required to solve the puzzle.
3. Move Count: Calculates and displays the total number of moves required for the given number of disks.
